# Mrey
## Based on blockchain
Decentarlized,Secure,Open Sorce Web browser

## ICO

We do not profit for the purpose, we hate fraud as you do, so we will not conduct ICO.

## Introduction
 Mrey's point-to-point decentralized network supports forking transactions without a central server or primary node. The multi-ledger network that supports bifurcated transactions makes them harder to track; POS consensus mechanism enables Mrey network to effectively defend against quantum computers and 51% attacks. Rigorous cryptographic protocols enable the network to fully secure the property of every user
## You are not a tool

### Why would you want to be treated like a tool
The Mrey browser blocks most web ads, mining scripts, and trackers, and the Mrey browser itself is free and open source. Mrey adopts the GPL V2 protocol to avoid future commercialization.
### Any browser support in the future
In the future, users will be able to mine any browser, IE, Chrome, or even TOR.
## The principle of forking transaction of Mrey Coin:
1. Ledger A records the payee's address, hash (key, collection address and amount on ledger B), and amount on ledger A. At the same time account B records the payee's address, hash (key, payee's address and amount on account B), and the amount on account B. The Mrey Coin used to trade before the key is published is locked.


2. Once either party publishes the key, Mrey Coin (hereinafter referred to as MYC) will be unlocked. The system will check whether the key matches the payee's address and the amount of money received, and the transaction can be completed after verification.
## More equitable mining
The value of MYC depends on how much time users spend browsing the web. Users only need to spend time, can obtain MYC, without professional miner.
## What does MYC do

### JavaScript store
You can use JS to set up a store, and users can use MYC to place orders automatically. Anyone can look at the source code, so people don't have to worry that the store is fleecing them.


Demonstration code:
```javascript

  var url = window.location.href, tmpArr = url.split('?'), tmp=tmpArr.split('send');

  //document.write tmp
  ```
### Mrey ADS
You can use MYC or a little bit of computing power to place pop-up ads on any web page. Only users who have browsed your AD can withdraw their MYC.
### Vote
Pay MYC to vote for your favorite websites. If there are too many "no" votes, fewer mycs will be dug up through the site.
### Mrey Site
Without a server, you can create a website on Mrey for free, with the source code stored on the blockchain. The website does not belong to anyone. If it needs to be shut down or blocked, all the accounts must be attacked successfully, and the POS consensus mechanism can effectively prevent these attacks.
## Pay attention to the protection of intellectual property rights
Mrey encourages users to browse original content. The earlier a site is created, the more MYC is dug up by browsing the site.
## What are the downsides of Mrey
* A large user base is required - there are still many people who don't know about the Mrey browser, which makes the Mrey network with very few online nodes. So now the stability of Mrey network is low.

* At this stage of development - some of the code for the Mrey browser still needs to be improved, and there may even be some bugs to deal with.
* 
No professional development team - all versions of Mrey were developed by volunteers in their spare time. The number of developers in Mrey is currently small.
## They don't know us
### But we know them

## Media
### They have never heard of us, they will not pay attention to us in the future, we just like their icon.
